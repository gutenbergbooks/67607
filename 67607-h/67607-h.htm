<p>Once on a time&mdash;the story-book time when an-i-mals wore clothes
and could talk&mdash;there were three mod-el mice. Their names were
Gray Cloak, Fine Ear and Sat-in Slip-per. Sat-in Slip-per had a spoon
of her own, Fine Ear had a knife, and Gray Cloak owned a fork.</p>

<p>One day they thought they would club the knife and the fork and
the spoon to-geth-er, and keep house. As they were mod-el mice, they
eas-i-ly a-greed where to live. They chose Farm-er Jones' cel-lar,
be-cause there were bar-rels of ap-ples, bas-kets of eggs, and shelves
loaded with good-ies, and an egg, or an ap-ple, or a stray cake would
not be missed.</p>

<p>"I lived once," said Gray Cloak, "in the cel-lar of a wom-an who
bought by the doz-en or the dime's worth, and she missed the least
lit-tle thing at once, so that fi-nal-ly I left in dis-gust."</p>

<p>Such good times as those three mice had! The cel-lar had a
smooth, wa-ter-limed floor, a beau-ti-ful place to play mar-bles,
blind-man's-buff and Kit-ty-kit-ty-cor-ner. They always ate from the
same egg, and as Farm-er Jones kept his cats at the barn, there was
noth-ing to spoil their comfort for many years.</p>

<p>Floss and Fluff were the hap-pi-est dogs in the world. Floss knew
how to snap, and Fluff knew how to whine, and if they had been let to
go hun-gry, or cold, or had been scold-ed, they'd have been cross,
naught-y dogs.</p>

<p>But Floss and Fluff had a good mas-ter. He was a lit-tle boy on-ly
six years old, but he was a first-rate mas-ter. His pa-pa said when he
brought Floss and Fluff home:</p>

<p>"Now, Fred-dy, just as long as these lit-tle fel-lows are hap-py,
just so long they are yours!"</p>

<p>Fred-dy knew what that meant. He fed his beau-ti-ful pets at
reg-u-lar hours ev-er-y day, and e-ver-y day he combed and brushed
them, and ev-er-y day he took them out for a frol-ic, and they had
their baths at the right time, and he nev-er held up a bone and did not
give it to them. Be-cause he was so prompt and true and kind, Fred-dy
was hap-py, and so were Fluff and Floss.</p>

<p>The ba-by in the house and the ba-by in the barn, are great friends.
The barn ba-by is not per-mit-ted to come in-to the house, but the
house ba-by vis-its the barn ev-er-y day.</p>

<p>The house ba-by is a year old, and the barn ba-by is just a year
old too; but the house ba-by can on-ly take lit-tle trem-bling steps,
holding fast by moth-er's hand, while the barn ba-by, if he can on-ly
get out of doors, throws up his heels and runs a-cross the fields, and
no-bod-y can catch him.</p>

<p>The house ba-by laughs to see him go, and dear-ly likes to pat
his red hair, and feel his two stout lit-tle horns. And I think the
barn ba-by likes to feel the soft hand of his lit-tle friend from the
house, for some-times there is salt, and some-times there is su-gar on
the lit-tle pink palm, and the barn ba-by licks it off with his rough
tongue. Once the barn ba-by tried to say, "Thank you." He tried this
way: He reached his head up and licked the house ba-by's rose-pink
cheek. The house ba-by was scared, and so was the house ba-by's
moth-er&mdash;and she ran in-to the house with him just as fast as she
could; and then pa-pa laughed at them both, and the barn ba-by stood
and looked o-ver the fence for half an hour.</p>

</div>

<p>Not Cin-der-el-la of the glass slip-per&mdash;our Cin-der-el-la wore
i-ron shoes. She was an In-dian po-ny, and we all loved her. The pet
chick-en made a roost of her back, and the white cow licked her glos-sy
sides as she would her own calf.</p>

<p>Our four lit-tle out-door boys learned to ride on her gen-tle back,
and some-times they all got on at once&mdash;Ba-by Frank close to her
neck in the curve of Willie's arms, who held the bridle; Ed-die next,
with his chub-by hands clutch-ing Willie's sides; and Char-lie last,
much a-fraid of slip-ping off be-hind. They were all so small that
their short legs stood straight out a-cross her broad back. Mam-ma was
nev-er un-ea-sy, for Cin-der-el-la had nev-er been coax-ed out of a
walk since they had had her.</p>

<p>But one day a cow came in sight of this horse-back par-ty, and
Cin-der-el-la pricked up ears, and started off in a gal-lop! Char-lie
slipped off be-hind. Ed-die went o-ver side-wise. Frankie screamed, but
Wil-lie held him close, and kept his seat un-til the cow turned off
in-to a fence-cor-ner, and lay down. Then Cin-der-el-la stopped, and
the boys that fell off came limp-ing up.</p>

<p>They found out that the po-ny had been used on the plains to fol-low
cat-tle. Af-ter this, when these boys want-ed a brisk ride, they tried
to get be-hind a cow.</p>

<p>One day, when mamma went to drive and left Ba-by-boy Joe with Nel-ly,
she found out ten things that lit-tle ba-by-boys like.</p>

<p>She found that Ba-by-boy Joe liked to dance at the Ba-by-boy Joe
in the mirror. He liked to hold the paper-weight&mdash;a smooth
round stone, like an egg. He liked to hold a soft, fragrant, red
rose&mdash;Nel-ly gave him a white one, but he dropped it and held the
red one. He liked to be carried all a-bout the house. He liked to sit up
in his crib and pound a pillow with his lit-tle fists. He liked to hold
papas cane. He liked to put his hand on Pussy and smooth her soft fur.
He liked a tiny sip of wa-ter. He liked a branch of green leaves. And he
liked to hear Nel-ly sing.</p>

<p>All these things Ba-by-boy Joe had and did, in one short hour, while
mamma was a-way.</p>

<p>And when mamma came back he was fast asleep in his lit-tle brass bed,
and Nel-ly had put the house in or-der.</p>

<p>Once there was a fair swan with a coal-black neck. She had three
pret-ty ba-by swans, but they were lazy lit-tle things. They did not wish
to pick their own bugs, nor cut their own grass-salads, nor to swim.
They wished to take their bugs and grass from their moth-er's bill,
and to go up stream and down on her back. It was a pleasure to their
moth-er to feed them and to give them rides. But she knew they must be
taught to seek their own food, and to swim up and down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>When she spoke to them a-bout it, they said, "Next week we will."
Next week one of them did keep her word and swim, and seek her own
bugs, and nip grass for her-self. But the others still sat on their
moth-er's back. So one day when she was out in the stream, and they were
catching but-ter-flies from her back, the moth-er swan&mdash;with a fun-ny
smile at her good child&mdash;dived, heels o-ver head, and let the lazy
swans fall off. Then up she came and swam off as fast as she could,
in among the reeds, where she stayed all night. By morn-ing her lit-tle
swans had learned their lesson.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nye loves peace and a quiet house. But Robby Nye, her lit-tle
son, loves racket, noise, hubbub, con-fu-sion and war. Mrs. Nye has
to fold newspapers in-to soldier-caps and she has to cut out epaulets
and belts and straps and stars and badges, and her room is strewn with
these things&mdash;some-times she has to cut out and pin on whole suits
of armor.</p>

<p>And when Mrs. Nye leaves her chair she is likely to step on
a tin soldier and her dress sweeps down whole regiments. Bang! bang!
cries Robby, and charges up and down the room. He thinks he looks like
a great general&mdash;in his own mind he swells up to a tre-men-dous
size. But at night this terrible soldier creeps up in-to his mamma's lap
just like other boys.</p>

<p>In ran Tiptoe. Tiptoe had news to tell. But they were all asleep.
Asleep in the daytime, Grandpa in his big chair, Ned on one knee, and
Ba-by on the other. "O what a waste of time!" thought Tiptoe. "They
don't know what I have seen! dandelions in the grass! bluebirds on the
fence! Chickens in Speckle's coop! three lit-tle new cats at the barn!
and the sun shines and the wind blows! and the clouds race a-cross the
sky!" Tiptoe barked for joy, his lit-tle dog-heart was so glad in him. I
am quite sure it was the bright weather with all things growing and
stirring, that made Tiptoe bark for joy.</p>

<p>The barking awoke Ba-by. Ba-by woke Ned, and Ned woke Grandpa, and
they all went out with Tiptoe for a walk, and were so glad and gay they
could have barked too.</p>

<p>I wish I knew the names of those first two dear lit-tle chil-dren who
thought how to clasp their four hands in a way to make a seat to carry
a child, and where they lived, and how long ago it was. Don't you? They
must have been kind chil-dren.</p>

<p>One rainy day last week, when Ba-by Sybil was not well and cried and
would not play, Jack and Jessie made a carriage with their hands, and
Sybby rode all o-ver the house, and made calls and saw the sights, as
hap-py as she could be. "Trot! Trot fast!" Sybby cried. Then her span
went fast. "Whoa! Slow, slow!" called the lady in the coach. Then her
horses walked. This was Sybil's favorite play.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
